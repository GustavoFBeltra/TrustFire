    question: "How does TrustFire ensure legal compliance?",
    answer: "All transfers on TrustFire are conducted through licensed Federal Firearms Licensees (FFLs). Background checks are performed in accordance with federal law, and we maintain complete digital records of all transactions to ensure full compliance with ATF regulations.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need to be a licensed dealer to use TrustFire?",
    answer: "No, TrustFire is designed for both private individuals and licensed dealers. Private sellers can list firearms, and buyers can browse listings. All transfers are completed through verified FFLs who handle the legal requirements.",
  },
  {
    question: "What fees does TrustFire charge?",
    answer: "TrustFire is free to download and use. FFLs may charge their standard transfer fees for facilitating the transaction. Optional services like escrow protection may have additional fees.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I verify an FFL on the platform?",
    answer: "All FFLs on TrustFire undergo verification through our secure system. We verify their license status with the ATF and maintain up-to-date records. You can view an FFL's verification status, ratings, and reviews before selecting them for your transfer.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if there's an issue during the transfer?",
    answer: "Our support team is available to help resolve any issues. All communications are documented within the app. If you use our optional escrow service, funds remain protected until the transfer is successfully completed.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use TrustFire in my state?",
    answer: "TrustFire is available nationwide, but firearm transfer laws vary by state. Our platform helps you find FFLs in your area who are familiar with your state's specific requirements. Users are responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable state and local laws.",
